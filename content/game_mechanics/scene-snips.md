### Scene: The Dare

John crouched by the sauna steps, camera clutched in one gloved hand, his other tugging the hood of his borrowed coat tighter around his ears. His breath came in quick, steamy bursts, fogging the phone screen. Snow crunched faintly beneath his wellies as he shuffled for a better angle.

Nika was already in position—barefoot in the snow, completely naked, a wooden bucket held high above her head like a Norse statue. Steam rose off her in curls, clinging to the sharp air.

She hadn’t flinched when she stepped out. She never did. It wasn’t bravado. Just… her.

He braced to take the shot, then hesitated. 

Something pressed at the edge of his awareness.

Not sound. Not sight. Just… presence.

The woods behind him were still. Silent. But a small, primal part of his brain whispered.

He turned, scanning the treeline. Pines faded into grey mist. Nothing moved.

He waited, holding breath he didn’t realise he’d taken. Snow creaked faintly beneath his boots. Still nothing.

  

“John?”

Her voice, casual. Light.

“You ready?”

  

He startled slightly, looked back, phone now trembling in his hand.

  

“Yeah—yeah. Go for it.”

  

Nika grinned, eyes flashing with the challenge, and tipped the bucket.

  

A rush of water. Steam exploded into the air. She didn’t shiver, didn’t shriek. Just stood there like it was nothing.

  

John snapped the photo.

  

Later, he wouldn’t remember the shot. He’d remember the moment before it. The pause.

The way the trees had stared back.
