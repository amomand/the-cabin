# Wildlife Mechanic

## Overview

Rooms in the game may contain wildlife, which brings atmosphere, unpredictability, and survival tension. Wildlife are not necessarily enemies — many are ambient or docile — but their presence should be reflected in the game’s sensory descriptions and AI responses.

## Behaviour

- Each room can support a **maximum number of wildlife entities**.
- Rooms define a **pool of wildlife types** that can appear.
- Wildlife can be **ambient**, **skittish**, **docile**, or **vicious**:
  - `ambient` — exists only to be described (e.g. owls, ravens)
  - `docile` — does not attack, may flee or watch silently
  - `vicious` — attacks *only if provoked*
- Vicious animals **do not attack by default** unless the player provokes them (e.g. tries to attack, throw an object, or make loud noise).
- The AI should weave wildlife into responses *even when not directly prompted*, e.g.:
  - *“An owl stirs in the trees above, startled by your movement.”*
  - *“You hear a distant howl — low, and far too long.”*

## Traits

Each wildlife entity may have traits, such as:

- `docile`
- `vicious`
- `skittish`
- `ambient`
- `massive`
- `elusive`
- `watchful`
- `predatory`
- `nocturnal`
- `symbolic` (used for folklore or Lyer connections)

## Interaction Possibilities

Players can attempt actions like:

- `listen` — AI should respond with ambient wildlife sounds based on what is present
- `look` — AI may describe what animals can be seen
- `throw stone at owl` — May cause the owl to flee or trigger aggression from others
- `approach reindeer` — Could cause skittish wildlife to flee

## Room Design

Each room can define:

- `max_wildlife` — Maximum number of wildlife in that room
- `wildlife_pool` — List of species that may appear
- The AI should only reference wildlife currently instantiated in the room

## Wildlife List (Finnish Wilderness)

| Name               | Traits                                 | Notes |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------|
| **Reindeer**       | docile, herd                            | Common in the north, sometimes wandering |
| **Eurasian Elk**   | docile, massive, skittish               | Large and powerful, best left alone |
| **Brown Bear**     | vicious, massive, solitary              | Rare, terrifying if encountered |
| **Wolf**           | vicious, pack, skittish                 | Attacks only when provoked — or corrupted |
| **Eurasian Lynx**  | elusive, silent, predatory              | Haunting presence — rarely seen |
| **Wolverine**      | aggressive, tough, elusive              | Small, chaotic, and dangerous |
| **Fox**            | docile, skittish, curious               | Often nearby — clever and nimble |
| **Mountain Hare**  | docile, fast, white (in winter)         | Easy to startle — fast flash of movement |
| **Snowy Owl**      | ambient, watchful, nocturnal            | Fixed gaze, always present in the trees |
| **Eagle Owl**      | ambient, predatory, large, nocturnal    | Wingspan like a shadow falling across the snow |
| **Capercaillie**   | ambient, startling, aggressive (if disturbed) | May burst from cover suddenly |
| **Raven**          | ambient, watchful, symbolic             | Common but unsettling — tied to death lore |
| **Pine Marten**    | elusive, arboreal, thief                | Mischievous, often unseen but noisy |
| **Saimaa Seal**    | docile, aquatic, rare                   | Only appears in lake-adjacent rooms

## Optional: Lyer-Influenced Wildlife Variants

Certain animals may appear or behave strangely due to the presence or influence of the Lyer. These traits are **optional flags** that can be applied selectively.

| Folkloric Mutation            | Effect |
|------------------------------|--------|
| **Trackless**                | The animal leaves no tracks, even in fresh snow |
| **Mirror-eyed**              | The animal’s eyes reflect back too clearly — like glass |
| **Unblinking**               | The creature never blinks, even in wind or snow |
| **Too Still**                | The animal holds eye contact for minutes without movement |
| **Repeating**                | A raven or fox repeats a word it shouldn’t know |
| **Half-shadowed**            | The creature’s shadow is incomplete or doesn’t match its form |
| **Cold-blooded**             | Touching them (or their tracks) feels *wrongly* cold |
| **Wrong Sound**              | The sound it makes doesn’t match the species — or voice

These traits can be used by the AI to flavour eerie moments, even if the animal appears docile. They may also indicate the Lyer’s presence nearby or reflect a room's corruption.
