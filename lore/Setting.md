# üèîÔ∏è Setting ‚Äì *The Cabin*

A remote slice of Finland. Snow-drowned silence. Something ancient lies still beneath it all.

## The Cabin

- **Location:** Deep in the Finnish wilderness, on the shores of a lake (exact name optional or procedurally generated)
- **Type:** Traditional m√∂kki (summer cabin)
- **History:**
  - Belonged to Eli‚Äôs family for generations.
  - Built with minimal amenities ‚Äî rustic, isolated, deeply tied to Finnish culture.
- **Interior:**
  - Sparse, wood-panelled, with old-fashioned furniture and a wood-burning stove.
  - Dusty shelves with odd trinkets, family photos, and perhaps some old, yellowed books.
- **Surroundings:**
  - Pine forest on all sides.
  - Narrow gravel road leads in ‚Äî unploughed in winter.
  - Small dock at the edge of the lake.
- **Significance:**
  - Ground zero for the Lyer‚Äôs influence.
  - Acts as both a sanctuary and a trap.
  - May contain hidden objects, old diaries, or markings that hint at what‚Äôs been forgotten (or ignored).

## The Forest

- **Description:** Thick boreal forest (taiga) of pine, birch, and spruce.
- **Atmosphere:**
  - Quiet enough to hear snow fall.
  - Wind howls, but the trees never seem to sway quite right.
  - Wildlife is... too quiet.
- **Features:**
  - Narrow trails, many of them unmarked or overgrown.
  - Frozen creek, abandoned fire pits, animal tracks.
  - Possible ruins or strange stone formations buried in snow and moss.
- **Significance:**
  - Acts as a liminal space ‚Äî characters become disoriented, lost in both time and distance.
  - It is *not* empty. The Lyer‚Äôs influence grows deeper the further you stray.
  - Cold seems to thicken unnaturally in certain places.

## The Lake

- **Description:** Vast, still, black beneath the ice.
- **Seasonal State:** Frozen solid in winter, misty and glassy in spring/autumn.
- **Supernatural Hints:**
  - Locals say you shouldn‚Äôt stare into it too long.
  - Some say the ice sings on certain nights.
  - In the right conditions, shadows move beneath ‚Äî not fish, and not ice shifts either.
- **Significance:**
  - Symbol of the Lyer‚Äôs stillness and depth.
  - Possible events: someone falls through, something rises, or a reflection doesn‚Äôt match what‚Äôs above.

## The Nearest Town (optional name: *Kivisaari* or *Korpikyl√§*)

- **Distance:** 30‚Äì60 minutes by car, depending on snow and road conditions.
- **Vibe:** Small, quiet, deeply local. A petrol station, a bar, a hardware store. That‚Äôs about it.
- **Locals:**
  - Friendly on the surface, but guarded.
  - Some remember old stories, but won‚Äôt talk easily.
- **Significance:**
  - May act as a hub for information, supply runs, or subtle foreshadowing.
  - Characters here may seem normal ‚Äî until they say something that chills the blood.

## Other Structures on the Land

- **Sauna:**  
  - Separate building, closer to the lake.  
  - Traditionally wood-fired ‚Äî no electricity.  
  - Steam and silence are both thick.  
  - A place where boundaries thin.  

- **Old Shed:**  
  - Falling apart, filled with old tools.  
  - Something has nested here.  
  - One wall may have carvings or sigils scratched into the inside.  

- **Root Cellar or Ice House (optional):**  
  - Locked. Why?  
  - Temperature feels wrong ‚Äî colder than outside.  
  - Smells faintly of pine tar and rot.

## The Weather

- **Primary Mood Tool:**
  - Oppressive cold. Biting wind. Sudden stillness.
  - Weather responds subtly to supernatural presence (colder, darker, more still).
- **Events:**
  - Sudden snowstorms trap the characters.
  - Mist on the lake that never quite lifts.
  - Sound doesn‚Äôt carry the way it should.

## The Temporal Feel

- **Time acts strangely.**
  - Watches stop or fall behind.
  - Days blend together in the low light of winter.
  - Memories and dreams blur into one another.
