The gravel drive narrowed as it left the road, the tyres crunching softly until the trees closed in and the sound disappeared into them. Elli cut the engine and sat for a moment, hands still on the wheel, listening to the car tick and settle as it cooled. The air outside was cold and unmoving, the kind of cold that felt deliberate. Frost glazed the ground in thin, brittle patches, catching what little light there was.

She stepped out and pulled her jacket tight. The driveway curved away from the car and into the forest, between pine and birch. The trees leaned inward as they always had, tall trunks tilting just enough to feel intentional. Their branches vanished upward into darkness, and beyond them the forest thickened into something she could not see into at all. Familiar, yes, but not welcoming. The sort of place that remembered you whether you wanted it to or not.

Somewhere past the bend stood the cabin. Hers now, on paper at least, though it had never quite felt that way. She had not planned to come back, not this year. But the blur on the northern camera, followed by silence, had left her with little choice. No signal from the other feeds. Nothing since. The phone in her pocket hunted uselessly for reception as she walked, boot soles crunching on frozen gravel, each step carrying her further from the car and deeper into ten acres of quiet.

The forest swallowed the driveway whole before the cabin finally emerged, a darker shape against darker trees. Elli climbed the last stretch, breath faint in the air, and reached the door.

It groaned as it opened, the same low, drawn-out sound it had always made. Inside, the smell arrived first. Dry wood. Dust. A hint of damp pine needles. Beneath it, softer and older, was smoke. Not the clean scent of a hearth, but something faint, sunk deep into the grain of the walls. The floorboards creaked under her boots as she stepped in, the sound too loud in the small space.

The cabin looked unchanged. The square table stood where it always had. The enamel sink caught a sliver of weak light from the tiny window, which seemed better at letting the cold in than anything else. And yet something felt wrong. Not broken, not disturbed, just slightly off, as though the place had shifted by a degree or two while she had been gone.

She set her pack down and did not move. Stood there, staring at the kitchenette, letting the quiet stretch. Remebering.

She was nine, maybe ten. Winter again. Waking in the dark to a sound she could not place at first, scraping and rhythmic, like something being dragged slowly across the floor. She had frozen, too afraid to even turn her head. Her parents had said it was the trees, or the ice settling. She had accepted that, because the alternative was unthinkable. But it had been inside. She had never told them.

The thought tightened in her chest, and with it came another memory, her grandmother’s voice, casual and unconcerned as she shaped karjalanpiirakka at the table.

Of course, it wasn’t this cabin back then. My grandparents had the old one, near the slope before the forest moved.

Before the forest moved.

Elli blinked.

The light from the window seemed dimmer now, the edges of the room softer, as though the shadows had thickened. The smell of smoke felt stronger, closer. She shook her head, the moment breaking, and found herself once again standing in the darkened cabin, the present snapping back into place.

She reached out without looking and flicked the light switch. She knew exactly where it was.

Nothing happened.

No hum, no glow. Just silence.

The power must be out.
