# The Lake in Winter

The road ended where the forest began, and Elli sat in the rented car with the engine off, watching the trees darken. She had told herself she would not come back. She had told John the same thing, though in softer language, the kind of language that left room for revision. And here she was, revising.

The cameras had been her compromise. Four of them, mounted at the cabin's corners two summers ago, feeding grainy footage to a server she checked from her phone in their apartment in Brooklyn. She checked it the way she checked the weather — a reflex, rarely meaningful. Pine trees in low wind. Snow falling and settling. A fox, once, crossing the clearing at dawn. For two years the cameras had shown her nothing but the slow passage of seasons in a place she had chosen to leave behind.

Then, eleven days ago, the northern camera had picked up something. A shape, briefly, at the far edge of its frame. Not an animal — the proportions were wrong, the movement too deliberate. A single frame of grey against grey before the feed cut out. Then the eastern camera went dark. Then the western. Then the southern. Four feeds, four failures, in the space of ninety minutes. After that, nothing. The server was still running, still drawing power, but the cameras sent back only black.

She had tried to explain this to John. A malfunction, she said. Probably ice on the housing. Probably nothing. He had looked at her the way he sometimes did when she talked about the cabin — not dismissive, but careful, measuring the distance between what she was saying and what she meant.

"So go," he said. "I'll survive without you for a weekend."

She hadn't corrected him. She hadn't said that it wasn't really about the cameras, or that the shape on the feed had settled into her chest and stayed there, cold and compact, for eleven days. She had packed a bag and driven north from Helsinki in silence, through towns that grew smaller and further apart until the last one disappeared behind her and there was nothing left but birch and pine and the grey weight of the sky.

The cabin was exactly where it had always been, which should not have been a thing worth noticing, but was. It sat in its clearing, the dark wood of its walls almost indistinguishable from the trees behind it. Snow had gathered on the roof in a thick unbroken sheet. No tracks in the clearing. No sign that anything had come or gone in weeks.

Elli stood at the edge of the tree line with her bag over one shoulder and her breath thin in the air. The temperature had dropped since she left the car — sharply, in a way that did not feel like wind chill or altitude. The cold had a pressure to it, a density. It sat against her skin and did not move.

She crossed the clearing. The snow compressed under her boots with a sound that carried further than it should have. When she reached the door, she paused with her hand on the latch and listened. She was not sure what she was listening for. The forest behind her was silent — not quiet, but silent, the difference between a room where no one is speaking and a room where someone is holding their breath.

The door opened with its familiar groan, low and slow, wood dragging against the frame. Inside, the air was stale and cold and layered: dry timber, dust, pine, and beneath all of it, faintly, smoke. Not recent smoke. Something older, something that had seeped into the grain of the walls over decades and could not be cleaned out.

She set her bag down and stood still. The cabin's single room opened around her — the square table, the enamel sink catching a thin blade of light from the window, the iron stove cold and closed, the narrow door to the konttori half-open. Everything in its place. Everything undisturbed. And yet the room felt misaligned, subtly, the way a photograph can look wrong when it has been reframed at a slightly different angle.

She crossed to the circuit breaker in the konttori and found it tripped. She flipped it. The lights came on, pale and humming, and the cabin contracted around her into something smaller and more familiar. She exhaled. Her shoulders dropped. She had not realised how tightly she had been holding herself.

The lake was a fifteen-minute walk from the cabin, down a path that wound through birch and pine before opening suddenly onto the shore. Elli had not planned to go down there — she had come for the cameras, to check the housings, to clean the lenses if they were iced over, to find a reason for the failure and carry it home to Brooklyn where reasons made things manageable. But the northern camera was mounted on a post near the water, and so the lake was unavoidable.

She reached it as the light was failing. The sky had thickened into a low uniform grey, the kind that erased the horizon and made the world feel compressed, as though the air itself had a ceiling. The lake stretched out from the shore, vast and dark and perfectly still. Ice covered it from bank to bank, thick enough to walk on, though she had no intention of doing so. Beneath the ice, the water was black.

The camera post stood at the edge of the shore, tilted slightly, the housing intact but the lens dark. Elli brushed snow from the casing and checked the cable. It was connected. The housing was dry inside, no condensation, no ice, no damage. She powered it off and on again. The LED flickered once, then nothing. She tried the other cameras on her way back and found the same thing — intact, undamaged, functional in every way she could measure, but dark.

She stood at the last camera post, the western one, at the edge of the clearing where the trees pressed closest, and looked back at the cabin. Warm light fell from the windows onto the snow. The stove was still cold — she would need to gather wood before dark — but the electric heater she had found in the konttori was running, and the cabin looked, from the outside, like a place where a person was living. She tried to take comfort from this and found that she could not. The warmth in the windows looked borrowed. Temporary.

---

She woke in the dark.

Not suddenly — there was no sound, no jolt, nothing she could point to as the thing that had pulled her out of sleep. She simply opened her eyes and was awake, completely, in the way that leaves no room for drowsiness. The cabin was dark. The heater had shut off. The air was cold, and getting colder.

She lay still and listened. The silence was total. No wind against the walls, no settling of timber, no sound from the forest at all. It was the kind of silence that had a texture, that pressed against the ears. She became aware of her own breathing, how loud it was, how it filled the room.

Then she heard it.

Not a sound, exactly. A shift. A change in the quality of the silence, a displacement, brief and sourceless. She lay rigid under the blanket, her eyes open, staring at the ceiling she could not see. Her body understood something before her mind did — her pulse was climbing, her muscles had locked, her breath had gone shallow and fast. She was afraid. Deeply, instantly, chemically afraid, the way she had been at nine years old, lying in this same darkness, hearing something drag itself slowly across the floor.

She forced herself to sit up. The cold hit her face and chest. She reached for her phone on the table beside the bed and turned on the torch. The light carved a narrow column through the dark, and she swept it across the room — table, sink, stove, the door to the konttori still half-open. Everything in its place. Nothing moved.

She sat on the edge of the bed with the phone in her hand and waited for her heart to slow. It did, eventually, though the fear did not leave. It settled, changed shape, became something quieter and more permanent. The heater was dead — the power had gone again, the breaker tripped or something else failed — but she did not get up to check. She sat in the dark with her phone light on and watched the room and did not sleep again.

---

In the morning, the power was back. She had not reset the breaker. She checked it anyway and found it in the ON position. The heater was running. The lights worked. Outside, the sky was the same low grey, and the temperature had climbed slightly, enough that the snow on the roof was beginning to soften at the edges.

She made coffee on the electric ring and stood at the window drinking it, looking out at the clearing and the tree line beyond. The trees stood in their rows, still, tall, leaning inward. She had grown up with those trees. She had played beneath them, climbed them, feared them in the dark. They had not changed. They had not moved.

Before the forest moved, her grandmother had said, shaping karjalanpiirakka at this same table with flour-dusted hands. Elli had been young enough that the words had passed through her without catching on anything. Her grandmother had not elaborated. She never did, with things like that. She would say something — strange, sideways, impossible — and then continue with whatever she was doing, and the moment would close behind the words and leave no opening for questions.

Elli finished her coffee and pulled on her boots and went down to the lake.

---

The ice had changed. She noticed it from the top of the path, before she had even reached the shore. Yesterday it had been white and opaque, snow-covered, featureless. Now it was darker. The snow had melted or compacted or been swept aside — she could not tell which — and the ice beneath was exposed, grey and translucent, with a depth to it that made her stomach tighten. She could see into it. Not far, not clearly, but enough. Dark shapes beneath the surface, deep down, that could have been rocks or silt or submerged timber, or could have been nothing at all.

She walked to the shore and stopped. The lake was still, the air above it was still, and the ice stretched out flat and dark toward the far shore, where the trees were a thin black line barely distinguishable from the sky itself. No wind, no birdsong, no sound of water.

She stood there for a long time. She was not sure why. There was nothing to see, nothing to do, no reason to stay. But she could not bring herself to turn around. The lake held her attention in a way she could not explain — not with beauty or interest but with something else, something quieter, something that had weight and shape but no name. She had stood here before, many times, and the lake had always been the lake. But today it felt different. Today it felt like the lake was also standing still.

A crack ran through the ice somewhere far out, a deep percussive sound that travelled across the surface and reached her several seconds after it had happened. She flinched. The sound faded into the silence and the silence closed over it.

She looked down at the ice near the shore. It was clear here, almost glass-like, and she could see the stones on the lake bed a few feet below. Dark water between the ice and the stones, unmoving. She leaned closer. Her reflection looked back at her, grey and featureless.

Then her reflection moved.

Not in the way reflections move — not in response to her, not a mirror of her shifting weight or her breath fogging the air. It moved independently. A slight turn, a fraction of a degree, and then it was still again, and she was staring at it, and it was staring back, and it was not her face.

She stepped back. Her boot slipped on the frozen shore and she caught herself, one hand down in the snow, her whole body tight with the shock of it. She looked at the ice again. Her reflection was her reflection. Her face, her jacket, her hair escaping from under her hat. Nothing wrong. Nothing different.

She walked back to the cabin quickly and did not look behind her. The path through the birch trees felt longer than it had on the way down. The trees pressed close. The air was heavy and still and very cold.

---

That night she locked the cabin door, which she had never done before — there had never been a reason, not out here, not with the nearest neighbour an hour's drive south. She lit the stove and fed it until the fire was high and the cabin walls ticked with heat. She closed the konttori door. She checked the windows. She sat at the table with her hands around a mug of tea and watched the fire through the stove's glass panel and tried to think clearly.

The cameras were dead. The power was unreliable. Something had looked at her from under the ice. These were facts, or at least events, and she could arrange them in a line, but the line did not lead anywhere. It simply stopped, the way a path stops at the edge of dark water.

She thought about calling John, but there was no signal. She thought about driving back to Helsinki in the morning, and the thought sat in her mind like a stone, solid and reasonable, and she knew she would not do it. She could not explain why. It was not courage and it was not stubbornness. It was something else — a sense that leaving now would be worse than staying, though she could not have said worse how or worse for whom.

The fire cracked and settled. The wind picked up outside, pressing against the cabin walls in long slow gusts that made the timber creak. She listened to the creaking and tried to hear only wood, only wind, only the ordinary sounds of an old building in a cold forest. She was mostly successful.

When she finally lay down, she left the stove burning and the light on in the konttori. She closed her eyes and sleep came slowly, in shallow uneven waves. Somewhere in the space between waking and dreaming, she heard her grandmother's voice again, faint and unhurried, speaking to no one in particular.

*Before the forest moved.*

Elli lay in the narrow bed and stared at the dark behind her eyelids and felt the cold press close around the edges of the cabin's warmth, close and vast.

Outside, the lake was still. The ice was clear. And beneath it, deep in the black water, something waited.

It was very good at waiting.
