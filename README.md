# The Cabin

## What is this?

The silence hangs thick around you, disturbed only by the low hum of something old — a game engine, perhaps, or just the wind clawing at the cabin walls.

You fumble in the dark and find strange files:  
One feels like **Python** code — procedural, shifting.  
Another hums with **room layouts** and **item placements**, but they're wrong. Rooms lead back to themselves. Items whisper names they shouldn’t know.

Somewhere, beneath it all, something is building itself.  
It doesn’t need to be seen. Only played.

This is **The Cabin**.  
A procedurally generated text adventure set deep in the Finnish wilderness, where the cold isn't just weather — it's a warning.

## What to expect

- Maps that change every time you return.
- Rooms that feel... off.
- Events that happen once, or maybe never.
- A creature you won’t see. Not properly. Not yet.

And all of it generated — procedurally, yes — but also guided.  
By something colder than random.
