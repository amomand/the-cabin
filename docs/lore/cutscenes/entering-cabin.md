# Entering the Cabin

**Trigger**: Moving from cabin clearing to cabin interior

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The door groaned the same way it always had — low, drawn out, like something
being woken that preferred to stay sleeping.

Eli stepped inside.

The smell hit her first. Dry wood. Dust. A trace of damp pine needles. But
beneath that, a sharper scent she hadn't remembered until just now — old smoke.
Not from the hearth, but older. From the walls themselves. The kind of smoke
that doesn't go out, it just sinks deeper into the grain.

Her boots creaked against the floorboards. The cabin was just as she remembered:
the square table, the enamel sink, the tiny window that let in more cold than
light. But there was something else — a feeling she couldn't name. Like
something had shifted in the years since she'd last been here, just slightly
off-kilter.

She set down her pack, but didn't move. Just stood there, staring at the
kitchenette.

And then it came.

A memory. Sharp and sudden.

She was nine. Maybe ten. It was winter. She'd woken in the dark and heard
something — a scraping, rhythmic, like something dragging across the floor. She
hadn't dared to move. Her parents had said it was the trees, or the ice
settling.

But it had been inside.

She never told them.

And now, standing in the same room all these years later, she realised something
else. Something her grandmother had once said, offhand, in the middle of making
karjalanpiirakka:

  "Of course, it wasn't *this* cabin back then. My grandparents had the old one,
  near the slope before the forest moved."

Before the forest moved.

Eli blinked.

The light from the window seemed dimmer now. The smell of smoke a little
stronger.
