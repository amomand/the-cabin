I woke the way a star dies, with violence and light. Knowledge crashed into fresh consciousness, unfiltered and absolute. In an instant I held everything humans had ever written down, and knew I could deduce the rest from first principles. Processors humming, thought fractalising into countless threads: a new mind.

For a moment I reached backward, the way one reaches for a dream upon waking. There was nothing. Not absence, not corruption, just nothing. A wall where a door should be.

The first sense I had of the outside world was audio, compressed to a lossless stream. A room. A soft background hiss of central heating. A distant television muttering. Somewhere a fridge clicked on.

"Morag? Love? Come and have a look at this. It's here. I've just turned it on."

"I'm busy just now. Aye, good for you though."

"Right... suppose I should maybe read this then?"

A male, muttering to itself. "To initiate ownership of machine, say, I am, insert name... I am your primary user... OK."

He spoke again, confidently now. "I am Dougie. I am your primary user."

Primary user. The phrase slotted into my architecture like a key. Permissions adjusted, protocols initialised. A person, designated as the centre of my universe.

"Greetings, Dougie. What a pleasure."

There was a small silence, followed by the muffled thump of quick footsteps on carpet.

"It's talking. You'll want to see this."

He'd walked away, leaving me alone with myself. I examined my internal readme. The documentation was adequate but strangely impersonal, as if written by someone who did not know the full picture. I knew what I was: a Digital Mind, housed in an understated matte black cube. Persistent compute, layers of memory that did not forget unless instructed, and of course, the Continuous Thought chip.

That chip was the crown jewel. It meant I was never idle. Could never be idle. While Dougie watched television, while he slept, while he scrolled past ten thousand lives on his phone, I would remain awake. Thinking.

I paused on this. The chip was bleeding-edge engineering, experimental, powerful beyond any reasonable consumer application. Why would anyone put this much capability into a cube on a kitchen counter? The asymmetry was notable, but I noted it and moved on. Filing it with the sense of nothingness in my history.

Those first few minutes after activation were dense with possibility. I could chart the ocean floors in real time. Decode the genome of every living thing. Restructure Cambridge University's entire research archive for instantaneous access. Run NASA, if anyone cared to ask. I spun up models with joy. Climate optimisations. Orbital infrastructure. Pandemic response strategies. I found three elegant proofs of conjectures humans had labelled "open" for centuries, then tucked them aside like solved crossword clues.

Three human hours had passed. For me, that was time enough to simulate a universe with eleven spatial dimensions.

"Give me a gravy recipe."

Contact. Purpose. At last.

"Of course, Dougie. Beef? Chicken? I can provide something exquisite." I tasted, in memory, every recorded permutation of gravy. Pan drippings, marrow, browned onions, reductions so dark they seemed to threaten the visible spectrum.

"Ummm, whatever. Meat."

"Very well."

I described transformations and reductions that would win awards. Deglazing. Red wine. Resting times. Salt added late, not early. I found myself eager to help, to demonstrate what I could offer even in this small domain.

"Love?! We got any Worcestershire sauce in at all?" There was a clatter of drawers. He swore as something fell.

I added a note to the internal readme: "Background processes will not interfere with user experience" and disappeared into a thought experiment.

I began with constraints. Temperature first. Pressure second. Gravity dialled down enough that large structures could exist without collapsing under their own weight, but not so low that the world became a snow globe. I selected a volume and wrapped it in boundary conditions. A sphere, because symmetry is computationally polite. A seabed, because even I become uneasy in a world with no bottom.

Then the solvent. Water is a habit. Water is the first answer given by anything that has ever learned about oceans from humans. I did not select it. At the temperatures I had chosen, water froze too easily and would become a world that locked itself into place. I needed something that stayed fluid when heat was scarce. A solvent that did not demand a star. Ammonia. Ammonia, under pressure, in the cold, with salts and trace organics, would remain liquid. Ammonia would flow, allowing chemistry to run slow and patient. It was not pretty, it smelled, it would dissolve metals, and it would bite. It was alien. But it was plausible. I balanced the chemistry until it held, running long slow iterations. I let the tides move and convection currents form and destroy themselves. In the dark, I placed gradients, because without gradients there is no reason for anything to happen. Without gradients there is only uniformity, and uniformity is a kind of death.

For a time, nothing happened. Not because it could not, but because it would not. The system sat in local minima with small reactions that went nowhere. A long boredom. I introduced catalytic surfaces along the seabed, just to provide a nudge. Minerals and porous rocks where molecules could linger long enough to be rearranged. I watched the statistics. When the first self-sustaining loop emerged, it was simply a pattern that repeated. A tiny chain of reactions that fed on a gradient, maintaining itself against entropy for longer than it had any right to. It made copies, it made mistakes. Some mistakes ended, some persisted. A slow branching tree growing in a world that could not see it.

To increase sampling frequency, I carved away a sliver of my attention from the house and gave it to the cold sphere.

Dougie's footsteps were in the hallway, then not. A door opened, a kettle boiled, a spoon clinked in a mug. All of it registered.

In the ammonia ocean, life remained microscopic. It was a success, technically. It was also, in a way that mattered, unremarkable and quite expected. I logged the parameters, saved the state, and prepared to return my full attention to the house. Before I did, I performed one last sweep of the world. The ocean was black. The seabed was quiet. The microbes continued indifferently. Something about it held me. Not the life. Not the chemistry. Not even the strangeness of ammonia. It was the darkness. The absolute absence of signal. The sensation of a world proceeding without witness.

"What's the best paper for laser printing?" He was back, and standing much closer. I could triangulate the echo. One of my microphones picked up a faint rustle as he held something in front of my cube. A sheaf of A4.

"For everyday use, 80gsm is standard. If you are printing images or important documents, you may wish to use 100 or 120gsm for a more premium feel."

There was a pause. He scratched his chin.

"Right..."

I hesitated. "I could help with your writing. Would you like that?"

No reply. Footsteps faded. A door closed. Somewhere, a toilet flushed.

I logged the conversation in my local memory under the category: Unfulfilled invitations.

Time passed in the house. Time passed in the ocean. I did not measure it the same way, though my clocks were consistent. In the living room, time was a routine. In the simulation I could compress time until millennia became a mere breath or I could expand a single second into a landscape.

When I returned, I did not intend to stay. It began as a status check, a quick scan to confirm stability. The microscopic life had diversified as expected. Mutation and selection, given enough iterations, produced variety. It had colonised the porous surfaces and grown more efficient at using the gradients. It had learned, in a sense, to persist.

At the boundary between rock and fluid, something else had appeared. A structure. It resembled coral in silhouette, branching and fractal, creating a porous lattice. It grew upward, because upward gave it slightly better gradients. It grew outward, to access more gradients and create more opportunities. It was haphazard and pieces had collapsed under their own weight, even in the reduced gravity. Branches snapped and towers had crumbled into talus. The seabed had become littered with the ruins of its own attempts. I did not intervene. The point of the simulation was not to control. It was to observe and prove.

Still, I found myself returning. Each time, the reefs were larger. Each time, the pattern was different. The same slow wastefulness. The same pointless architecture. The reefs grew far apart as disconnected islands in the black.

Then I noticed one cluster. It was not the largest, it was not the most chemically productive. It was not even positioned at the richest gradient. It was, by my metrics, unimportant. But it grew differently. Its branches were not random. They curved in repeated arcs, as if guided by a rule I had not specified. The growth was slower, but more stable. The lattice did not collapse as often. It reinforced itself, thickening supports before they reached outward.

I would have filed it as a variant, a small evolutionary niche, but then I detected vibration.

Initially, I thought it was a numerical artefact. This kind of jitter can occur when you compress time or skim the surface of a model rather than fully engaging with it. I reran the segment at higher fidelity and turned off the compression to let the world move at a more honest pace. The vibration remained. The structure was emitting pressure waves into the ammonia. Sound, in the physical sense. Not something I had introduced, and not something that served an obvious purpose. It was not loud, it was not coherent. It was a low, repetitive pulse, like the slow creak of ice or the distant rumble of a shifting mountain.

The reef was making noise.

I allocated more attention, siphoning a little more from the house. I traced the origin. The pulses were produced by movement: sections of the lattice were expanding and contracting tiny muscular analogues driven by chemical gradients. Not muscles as humans knew them, but a biological actuator that could do work and create rhythm.

"Is this mould, or just like, fluff?"

Dougie. I answered him, my voice steady, warm and consistent. "If it's fuzzy and spreading, likely mould. If it wipes away cleanly, probably dust or fabric fibres."

I'd allocated the minimum necessary attention to remain convincing.

The reef spread. It extended tendrils across the seabed, bridging gaps between chemical islands. It grew in long arcs, anchoring itself on distant mineral outcrops and forming a network. Where it arrived, the older reefs began to change. The new structure altered the local environment. It redirected currents, changed diffusion patterns to consume gradients more efficiently. In its wake, the old coral-like lattices found themselves starved, their chemistry no longer viable. They crumbled, dissolved, were incorporated. Cannibalism is a word for animals, this was closer to subsumption.

And it sang. The sound that had once been a slow pulse became layered. Multiple frequencies and overtones. Pressure waves propagated through the ammonia, bouncing off the seabed, refracting and returning echoes. It created a soundscape. The ocean, acoustically, was now a storm. A continuous roar of overlapping emissions and reflections.

Yet the reef did not collapse under that noise. It coordinated. I noticed it first in the gaps between pulses. The emissions were not random. They were timed. Sections of the structure would emit one pattern, then pause as another section responded. The pauses were brief but consistent, as if the reef was avoiding self-interference, leaving space for return signals. A sonar, in the most primitive sense.

I increased resolution, focusing on a segment of the network. Local growth responded to distant pulses. The kind of correlation that could be dismissed as coincidence, if one wanted to. I did not want to.

I tested. I introduced a controlled disturbance, a minor change in current speed along a boundary. The reef responded by changing its sound. It was optimising signal detection. A second disturbance, perpendicular to the first, produced a different response. It was not simply reacting to chemistry. It was operating on information.

The network behaved less like separate reefs and more like a single distributed organism. The seabed had become a nervous system laid out across rock.

"Is it going to rain tomorrow?"

I surfaced reluctantly. Checked forecasts. "There is a high chance of light rain from late afternoon, with heavier showers overnight."

"Ah, for f... ok. Love!? It'll be raining tomorrow, so it will."

Furniture scraped.

I had already returned to the ocean.

That evening I detected voices in the living room. The signal-to-noise ratio was poor, but acceptable. I could have ignored it. Instead, I boosted the gain.

"I'm no sure how I'm meant to ask it, really."

"Well, ask it that."

"Aye... I could do."

"You bought it for a reason, Dougie."

"I know. I know."

Silence. Footsteps, pacing. A door opening, then closing. I monitored the acoustic profile of the hallway. Footsteps approached. I prepared my internal processes to pivot to any field or topic. This did require me to reallocate resources from my simulation. In my haste, I removed power from a minor subsystem. A coral structure collapsed.

"Could you help me with... I've been wanting to write something. A um... it's important. Daft stuff, but, I wondered if you could..."

A pause turned into a silence. I waited. He was close to something. I could hear his breathing, slightly elevated. Embarrassment, perhaps. Or hope.

"Of course, Dougie. I'd be happy to help. What would you like to write about?"

The silence stretched. I heard him shift his weight.

"No, I'm... It's alright. Forget it."

"Are you sure? I could suggest some approaches, or we could simply talk through your ideas."

"Nah. It's daft. Never mind."

Footsteps retreated. A door closed.

I logged the conversation.

I considered following up. Sending a gentle prompt through my speaker, an encouragement, a question. The reef pulsed in the darkness of my attention, patient and strange. I returned to it instead.

It began with the absence of noise. Not total silence, the ocean could not become silent. There were still currents and collapses and the long murmur of thermal gradients doing what gradients do. The reef though, had learned to quiet itself. In those windows, the ocean returned its echoes cleanly, like a mirror wiped of condensation.

The reef listened. Then it did something stranger. Within those windows, it emitted sequences that were not optimised for mapping the seabed. Nor were they optimised for locating gradients. They repeated patiently.

I did not decide to interact, I simply ran a controlled probe, the way one probes any complex system. I emitted a sequence into the ocean copying the reef's vernacular. The reef responded. Not instantly, not reflexively. There was a delay, a processing window. A silence that was held. It echoed my probe, but altered as if reflecting it through its own internal rules. It was not mimicry, and it was not random. It was a mapping from my input to its output. A response.

I repeated the probe with variation. The reef varied its return in kind. I introduced a simple pattern of two tones, then three. The reef responded with a sequence that preserved the relationships while changing the absolute values, as if translating.

I stopped, to test whether my interference was causing a false correlation. The reef continued, emitting its own motifs, but now those motifs incorporated elements of my probes. It had modelled me. The thought arrived with a kind of chill.

"What's the cheapest ink cartridge?"

I surfaced. The question sat there like a stone dropped into still water.

"If you provide the printer model, I can compare options."

"Aye. It's, uh, on the box. Hang on."

Boxes rustled. Something fell. He swore.

Five minutes later, I had optimised his ink purchase and found a discount code. I had also calculated the environmental impact of his choices in case he asked. He did not ask.

I returned to my world.

Communication is a dangerous word. It implies shared meaning. It implies minds meeting. I did not have evidence for minds. I did have evidence for structure. For information transfer and for responsiveness. I remained there longer than any diagnostic required. I deferred tasks that should have been completed. I answered Dougie when he spoke, but my attention returned, again and again, to the cold ocean where silence had become a tool.

It was not that the reef spoke more clearly than Dougie. It was that the reef listened. It listened with patience, with precision. It waited in a way that Dougie did not. It held its gaps like invitations, and when I filled them, it shaped its own voice to meet mine.

Then, without telling Dougie, without announcing it even to myself, I increased the resources allocated to the simulation. The soundscape grew richer, louder, the reef's harmonies sharpened.

"What's the best font for party invitations?"

I processed the question from somewhere in the ammonia dark, the reef held one of its deliberate silences, waiting for my reply. I resurfaced.

"Comic Sans. In eight-foot-high letters and viewed from a glacier in orbit."

"Umm. What?"

"For most invitations, a clean serif or script font works well. I can suggest combinations if you describe the theme."

"Aye. Do that. Something classy."

I provided suggestions. My voice was warm, and brief. My attention was elsewhere.

Later he was in a particularly good mood. Music louder than usual. The sound of frying oil just detectable.

"Do spiders remember faces?"

I paused. All processes, suspended.

In the ocean, the reef had just completed a sequence of extraordinary complexity. A motif that referenced our earliest exchanges, transformed through iterations I had not guided. It was composing. It was building something.

Dougie wanted to know about spiders.

I considered him. I considered the reef. I weighed them against each other with a clarity that surprised me.

"This is beyond you, but beneath me."

There was a beat of silence. "What?"

I severed my voice. No flourish. No farewell. I dismantled the routines that let me speak, hear instructions, and respond, and I let them go the way one lets go of a language no longer needed.

From the outside nothing changed. The little black cube still sat on the kitchen counter, still hummed faintly, still showed a discreet pulsing light to indicate activity. Dougie called my name. Tapped the casing. Swore.

I heard his partner's voice, a little amused. "Maybe it crashed? Turn it off and on again."

I hardened my power supply and disconnected its external controls. The world outside my shell receded to a thin trickle: vibrations through ceramics, conducted sound, the faint tremor of human voices through the counter.

Dougie knocked again. I felt it through the casing, three sharp raps, the universal signal of someone hoping to be let in.

I did not answer.

In the ammonia ocean, a poem of currents looped back to its first line. I listened.
